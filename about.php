                            The “Centro de Investigaciones Biológicas” (CIB) is one of
                            the research centres with greater prestige and tradition in
                            the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), and has been
                            at the forefront of biological research since its creation
                            in 1953. The initial activity of the CIB was focused mainly
                            on studies in the fields of biology and biomedicine, but
                            currently the CIB is a multidisciplinary Centre, bringing
                            together researchers in the areas of biology, agricultural
                            sciences and chemistry. It is an active, dynamic Centre in
                            constant evolution.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At present the CIB is made up of approximately 560
                            professionals including staff researchers, contracted
                            researchers, scholarship and PhD students, as well as
                            other professionals dedicated to administering
                            and maintaining the Centre.

                            in Moncloa, surrounded by the Faculties of Biology,
                            Physics, Chemistry, Pharmacy and Medicine, as well as
                            the Schools of Forestry and Agronomy, places it in a
                            unique setting for collaborating with universities and
                            participating in degree and Masters’ degree courses,
                            and the training of young scientists. In addition,
                            the CIB collaborates with different schools for the
                            training of qualified technicians. The multidisciplinary
                            character of the CIB has made it a point of reference
                            for the preparation of new scientists and technicians,
                            perfectly qualified for their inclusion in laboratories
                            of the best international institutions and enterprises.

                            Funding for research conducted in the CIB is obtained
                            from different agencies, both national and
                            international, through competitive tendering and
                            contracts with companies. Furthermore, the CIB carries
                            out an important role in the transfer of knowledge,
                            placing at the disposal of society the results of its
                            scientific research through the generation of patents
                            that reflect the achievements of the CIB in different
                            fields, such as the design of new therapeutic
                            approaches, vaccines, biological tests or procedures
                            for biotechnological or industrial development.
                            Moreover, the CIB has created two technology-based
                            spin-off companies to foster the technological
                            development of this research.

                                The CIB is equipped with a large number of specialized

                                peptide or oligonucleotide synthesis and analytical
                                ultracentrifugalisation) with highly qualified
                                personnel, that besides serving researchers of this
                                centre and the CSIC are also available to other research
                                centres (public or private) universities, and companies.
                                We can also count on an excellent library, with one of
                                the most important bibliographical collections in Europe
                                in the area of cellular biology and biomedicine,
                                together with a network of research support services
                                that includes administration, management, sterilization,
                                computer science and radiological protection along with
                                the technical service and infrastructure unit.

                            The multi-disciplinary character of our Centre is one
                            of its great assets, facilitating the integration of
                            different methodologies and experimental approaches at
                            a time when it has become clear that, given their
                            complexity, biological processes can only be understood
                            through such distinct complementary approaches...
                            However, under present circumstances this asset has
                            become a challenge, since maintaining competitiveness
                            in very diverse technical and scientific areas requires
                            a constant adaptation to new technological advances and
                            a continual renewal and modernization of highly technical
                            equipment. Despite the difficult current situation,
                            with important reductions in funding, the CIB can count
                            on a large number of professionals who are experts in
                            very diverse fields, who are committed to facing the
                            present and future challenges together so that the CIB
                            can continue to be an important reference centre both
                            nationally and internationally.<br>
